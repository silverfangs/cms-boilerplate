The works that we do are totally **free and will be free forever**. The reason we do this, is that we doesn't know, for example one day a person, who is very sad and maybe can't move on with his/her life again. **We always hope that our works will reach this kind of person, and enable to give him/her strength again to move forward and courageously facing each day challenges**.

However, to sustain and continue our works, we have to be honest, **any funding is required to support and keep our works to be alive**. If you wish to support us financially, you can do so at **any amount you like**. Just click the "Donate with PayPal" button below to support us.

**Despite any amount you gave us, we would like to say a big thank you!**

所有我们的作品是**免费以及是永远免费**。我们有如此的举动是因为，某一天，我们或许不知道有某位人士，在他／她 人生最底谷和沮丧的时候，我们的作品可以给到他／她 重新得到对生命的激情，希望，珍惜，以及勇气面对人生每一天。

但是，我们必须坦白，为了让我们可以继续的为大家贡献，我们的作品需要资金上的资助。如果您有意愿想要支持我们，您可以点击以下 "Donate with PayPal" 按钮来捐助资金来支持我们。

**无论数目大小，我们想说，感恩，因为有您我们会继续努力的**!
