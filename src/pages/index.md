  "Negativity" has tremendously damaging the lively in this world. It has
  separated us from being success and happy in life. Everyday, you open up the
  news in the paper or internet, bad news are everywhere, people hated each
  other, people murdering each other, people committed suicide, people in
  poverty. But we believe that can be change, imagine if this world today is in
  "Positivity" state, you walk on the street, and greet any person, everybody
  there is positive-minded and positive-attitude. Wouldn't that be great? So we
  believe in making a small change, we believe in our small effort by sharing
  positive message will at least make this world a better place for us and our
  children in coming generation.  Our mission in PostivMind.org is to share the
  "Positive Energy" to everyone. By here, the term "Positive Energy" meant that,
  we use our creativity to create workpiece that could be in the form of art,
  content, audio, video and other forms as long as we find it is appropriate to
  bring motivation and positive impact to the people in the society, be it like
  any person who needs motivation in their business, sports, working, studies,
  and of course to experience life to the fullest. Who will be appropriate to
  use our works? It could be any people, like businessman, sportsman,
  professions, students, or any person who needs motivation in their life. "消极"
  的力量已经破坏这世界许多的欢乐和幸福。它使我们隔离了我们应当有的快乐和成功。每一天，看到的新闻，无论是透过报纸或者互联网里，不快乐的事情到处都是。人们彼此憎恨，人们彼此杀害，人们不珍惜生命而自杀，活在贫苦的生活，等等。但是，我们相信这是可以改变的，想像看如果今天"积极"的力量到处都是，你在街上碰上的任何人都是以积极的思维和态度对待你。世界不就变成些美好吗？在《正能量》里，这是我们的希望，我们想用我们的努力投过"积极"的信息，至少带给这个世界一点点的改变，这是为了我们和以后的孩子们可以过的更美好的人生。 
  我们的使命：在《正能量》里，是希望能传扬"积极"的信息。在此，我们想使用我们的作品，例如画面，内容，音频，视频或其他的方式来推动和积极的影响需要动机的人，例如说像商业上需要动机的人，运动时需要动机的人，做工时需要动机的人，读书需要动机的人，等等。清楚的说，《正能量》的作品适合给商人们，运动员们，职业打工者们和学生们，带来动机以及影响他们能够得以成功和快乐。

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.
